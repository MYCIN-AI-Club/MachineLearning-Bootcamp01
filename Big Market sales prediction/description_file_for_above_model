Aim â€“ To predict the sales of the Big Market .

Dataset Description --
We have two csv files form kaggle community related to Big market 
sales -
	1-file.csv (8523 * 12)
	2-Predict.csv (5681 * 11)
file.csv  file contain both input and output variable(s). We need to predict the sales for the predict.csv data set.

Following columns are contianed by both csv files-->

ItemIdentifier ---- Unique product ID
ItemWeight ---- Weight of product
ItemFatContent ---- Whether the product is low fat or not
ItemVisibility ---- The % of the total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
ItemType ---- The category to which the product belongs
ItemMRP ---- Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
OutletIdentifier ---- Unique store ID
OutletEstablishmentYear ---- The year in which the store was established
OutletSize ---- The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
OutletLocationType ---- The type of city in which the store is located
*OutletType ---- Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
AND
ItemOutletSales(only contain by file.csv file) ---- Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.
(we have to predict this column for predict.csv)
 
Libraries Used --

1-> Numpy is used as np for linear algebra in our dataset.
2-> Pandas is used as pd for data processing reading our csv files.
3-> OrdinalEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing is used to interpret the           	ordinal datatypes.
4-> train_test_split from sklearn.model is used for spliting the csv file into two different parts for training and testing and this traing and testing file is further divided into into two parts x and y value i.e. input and output values . 
5-> LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model is used as model for our data prediction.
6-> mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics is used to find absolute and mean square error for our model to estimate the model accuracy.
7-> sns is imported from seaborn to see the relationship between different column with outcome variable at a same time.
