# Red Wine Quality Prediction
# Aim
The objective is to predict the quality of the wine by using many features. Dataset of Red Wine Quality is used from Kaggle.

# Dataset Description
In this dataset,features are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide,	 total sulfur dioxide, density,  pH, sulphates  and alcohol.
By the help of these features,we tried to predict the quality of the red wine. 

# Data Analysis




## Steps

```bash
Step#1: Import the required libraries
Step#2: Load the data
Step#3: Understand the data
        -drop unnecessary columns
        - Check for null values
        - Verify unique values of each column
        -Making different graphs
        -Finding corelations
Step#4: Build different Machine Learning Models
Step#5: Testing The model
Step#6: Finding the accuracy
```
